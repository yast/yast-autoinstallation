	  <title>Creating Primary and Extended Partitions</title>
	  <para>
	    By default, &autoyast2; will create an extended partition and will add all
	    new partitions as logical devices. It is possible however to
	    instruct &autoyast2; to create a certain partition as a primary
	    or as extended partition. Additionally, it is possible to
	    specify the size of a partition using sectors instead of size in Mbytes.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The properties <emphasis>partition_id</emphasis> and
	    <emphasis>partition_type</emphasis> control such behavior. To
	    specify the size in sectors, the list resource
	    <emphasis>region</emphasis> should be used.
	  </para>
	  &example.advancedPartitioning;
	  
	  <para>
	    The last example is only useful if you exactly know the
	    boundaries of the partitions and it does only make sense if you are creating
	    an exact copy of  a system, for example when cloning. The first
	    region entry in the list is the beginning of the region, the second
	    represents the length of the region.
	  </para>

	<section>
	  <title>Keeping Specific Partitions</title>
	  <para>
	    In some cases you might choose to keep some partitions untouched
	    and only format some target partitions, rather than creating them from
	    scratch. This might be the case of Linux installations have to
	    co-exist with another operating system or if certain partitions
	    contain data that you wish to keep untouched.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Such scenarios require certain knowledge about the target systems
	    and hard drives. Depending on the scenario, you might need to know
	    the exact partition table of the target hard drive with partition
	    id's, sizes and numbers. With such data you can tell &autoyast; to
	    keep certain partitions, format others and create new partitions if 
	    needed.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The following example will keep partitions 1, 2 and 5 and delete
	    partition 6 to create two new partitions. All kept partitions will
	    be only formatted.
	  </para>
	  &example.keepingpart;
	  <para>
	    The last example requires exact knowledge about the existing partition
	    table and about the partition numbers of those partitions that
	    should be kept. In some cases however, such data might be not
	    available, especially in a mixed hardware environment with
	    different hard drive types and configurations. The following
	    scenario is for a system with a non-Linux OS with a designated
	    area for a Linux installation.

		endterm="partitioning-keep1.title"/></quote> , &autoyast2;
	    should not in any case create any new
	    partitions,  instead  it should search for certain partition types on the system and use
	    them according to the partitioning plan in the control file. No
	    partition numbers are given in this case, only the mount points and
	    the partition types (Additional configuration data can be provided,

	  the CD-ROMs.

	  Installing additional and customized Packages
	</title>
	<para>
	  In addition to the packages available for installation on the CD-ROMs,
	  you can add external  packages including customized  kernels. Customized
	  kernel packages must be compatible to the  &company-suse;  packages and must
	  install the kernel files to the same locations.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Unlike earlier versions, to install custom and external packages
	  there is no need for a special resource in the control
	  file. Instead you need to re-create the package database and update
	  it with any new packages or new package versions in the source repository.
	</para>
	<para>
	  A script is provided for this task which will query packages
	  available in the repository and create the required package
	  database.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Creating a new package database is only needed if new RPMs
	  (i.e. update RPMs) were added. To re-create the database, use the
	  <command>/usr/bin/create_package_descr</command>
	  command. For example, use this command line to create the package
	  database. (When creating the database, all languages will be reset to English).
	</para>
	<example>
	  <title>Creating package database</title>
	  <screen>
cd /usr/local/CDs/LATEST/suse
create_package_descr  -d /usr/local/CDs/LATEST/suse 
	  </screen>
	</example>
	<para>
	  In the above example, the directory
	  <filename>/usr/local/CDs/LATEST/suse</filename> contains the architecture
	  dependent and independent packages, i.e. <emphasis>noarch</emphasis> and <emphasis>i586</emphasis>. 
	  This might look different on other architectures.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The advantage of this method is that you can keep an up-to-date
	  repository with fixed and updated package (i.e. from &company-suse; FTP
	  server). Additionally this method  makes the creation of custom CD-ROMs easier.

	  or to the individual package selection, installation will mostly fail due to conflicts.
	</para>
	<para>
	  To force the installation of a specific kernel, use the
	  <emphasis>kernel</emphasis> property. The following is an example
	  forcing the installation of the default kernel. In this example this
	  kernel will be installed in any case, even if an SMP or other kernel
	  is required</para>

	<title>Removing automatically selected packages</title>
	<para>
	  Some packages are selected automatically either because of a
	  dependency or because it available in a selection.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Removing such packages might break the system consistency and it is
	  not recommended to remove basic packages unless a replacement which
	  provides same services is provided. Best example for this case are
	  <acronym>MTA</acronym> packages. By default, <emphasis>postfix</emphasis>
	  will be selected and installed. If you wish however to use another
	  <acronym>MTA</acronym> like <emphasis>sendmail</emphasis>, then
	  postfix can be removed from the list of selected package using a list
	  in the software resource. The following example shows how this can be done:
