      <title>Collect information</title>
      <para>
	In order to create the control file, you need to collect information about the systems your are going to
	install. This includes among other things hardware data and network
	information. Make sure you know the following about the machines you want to install:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Hard disk types and sizes</para>	  
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Graphic interface and attached monitor if any</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Network interface and MAC address if known (i.e. when using &dhcp;)</para>
	</listitem>	
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
	With these parameters you are ready to go and create a profile of your systems
	to control the auto-installation process.

	Using the Configuration Management System
      </title>  
      <para>
	In order to create the control file for a specific computer, a &yast2; configuration
	based system is provided. This system depends on existing modules
	which are usually used to configure a computer in regular operation mode,
	i.e. after &company-suse; Linux is installed.
      </para>
      <para>
	The configuration management system lets you create control files easily and
	additionally it lets you manage a repository of configurations for use
	in a networked environment and with multiple clients.

	<para>
	  With some exceptions, almost all resources of the control file can
	  be configured using the configuration management system. The system
	  offers flexibility and  configuration of some resources is
	  identical to this  available in the &yast2; Control Center. In
	  addition to the existing and familiar modules new
	  interfaces were created for special and complex configurations,
	  for example for  partitioning, general options and software.	  
	</para>
	<para>
	  Furthermore, using the &cms; guarantees that the resulting control file is
	  valid and insures that it can be used directly to start  automated installation.

	  Make sure the configuration system is installed (package
	  <emphasis>autoyast2</emphasis> and call it using the <emphasis>YaST2 Control
	    Center</emphasis> or call it directly as root with the
	  following command (make sure the <emphasis>DISPLAY</emphasis> variable is set correctly to
	  start the graphical user interface instead of the text based one):

	<title>Import of Legacy and Foreign Configuration Files</title>

	<para>
	  &autoyast2; offers the option  to  import <abbrev>ALICE</abbrev> configuration files from
	  previous SuSE releases and foreign auto-installation systems
	  (Kickstart). Consult the chapter dealing with these issues in this
	  manual.

      <title>Creating/Editing a Control File Manually</title>
      <para>
	If you edit the control file manually, make sure it  has a valid syntax. To
	check the syntax, usesome tools already available
	on the distribution. For example to verify that the file is well
	formed, use the utility <command>xmllint</command> available with the
	<emphasis>libxml2</emphasis> package:     
      </para>
      <screen>
	xmllint &lt;control file&gt;
      </screen>
      <para>
	If the control file is not well formed, i.e. if a tag is not closed,
	<command>xmllint</command> will report about the errors.
      </para>    
      <para>
	Before going on with the auto-installation, please fix any errors
	resulting from such checks. The auto-installation process can't be
	started with  an invalid and non-well formed control file.
      </para>

      <para>
	You can use any XML editor  available on your system or use your
	favourite text editor with XML support (i.e. Emacs, Vim). However, it is not quite
	optimal to create the control file manually for large number of machines
	and it should only be seen as an interface between the auto-installation
	engine and the Configuration  Management System (<abbrev>CMS</abbrev>).
