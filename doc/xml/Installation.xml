    <para>
      After the system has booted and the control file has been retrieved,
      &yast2; performs configuration of the system according to the information
      provided in the  control file. All the configuration is summarized in a window that is shown by
      default and should be deactivated if a full automatic installation is
      needed.      
    </para>
    <para>
      When &yast2; has  reached the point where the summary of the configuration is shown,
      &yast2; has only probed hardware and prepared the system for
      auto-installation, thus, nothing has been changed in the system yet, so
      that in case of any error, the process still can be aborted.
    </para>
        
    <para>
      A system should be automatically installable without the need to have
      any graphic adaptor or monitor. Having a monitor attached to the
      client machine is nevertheless recommended to follow the process and
      to get feedback in case of any errors. Choosing between the Qt and the
      Ncurses interfaces is possible. For headless
      clients, system messages can be monitored using the serial console.
    </para>
    <section id="Installation.Interface.X11">
      <title>
	X11 Interface
      </title>
      <para>
	This is the  default interface while auto-installing. No special
	variables are required to activate it.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section id="Installation.Interface.SerialConsole">
      <title>
	Serial console
      </title>
      <para>
	You can start installing a system using the serial console by adding
	the keyword console (i.e. console=ttyS0) to the command line of the
	kernel. This will start linuxrc in console mode and later in the
	process, &yast2; also is started in serial console mode.

    <section id="Installation.Interface.Ncurses">
      <title>
	Text based YaST2-Installation
      </title>
      <para>
	This option can also be activated on the command line. This will start
	YaST2 in <emphasis>Ncurses</emphasis> mode. To start &yast2; in text
	mode, add <emphasis>textmode=1</emphasis> on the command line.
      </para>
      <para>
	Starting &yast2; in text mode is recommended when installing  a client
	with less than 64 MB or when X11 is not being configured at all,
	especially on headless machines.

    <title>Choosing the right Boot Medium</title>
    <para>
      There are different methods for booting the client. The computer can boot from
      its network interface card (NIC) to receive the boot images via  &dhcp; /TFTP
      or a suitable kernel as well as an initrd image are loaded from a
      floppy or a boot-able CD-ROM. 
    </para>
    <section>
      <title>
	Booting from a floppy
      </title>
      <para>
	For testing/rescue purposes or because the NIC does not have a PROM or PXE
	you can build a boot floppy to use with &autoyast2;. Using a floppy
	to initiate an auto-install process is limited due to the size of the
	data a floppy can hold. However, it is still  possible to use
	floppies when auto-installing a single, disconnected machine.
      </para>
      <para>
	Floppies can be used to store the control file, especially when using
	the original  &company-suse;  CD-ROMs for a single, disconnected machine. Using the
	kernel command line, you can specify the location of the control
	file on the floppy.
      </para>
      <para>
	Even without specifying any command line options, it is still possible to initiate the
	auto-install process by placing a control file on a floppy with a
	special, pre-defined file name. (<filename>autoinst.xml</filename>) &yast2; will check for
	<filename>autoinst.xml</filename> upon startup and if it was found it
	will switch from interactive to automated installation.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Booting from CD-ROM</title>
      <para>
	You can use the original  &company-suse;  CD-ROMs in combination with other
	media, i.e. with a floppy to hold the control file or in combination
	with network where the control file can be located.
      </para>
      <para>
	It is also possible to create customized CD-ROMs to hold only the
	package you need in addition to the control file which also can be
	saved on the CD-ROM. This method requires creation of CD-ROMs
	every time you wish to change the configuration though.
      </para>

    <section>
      <title>Booting via PXE over the network</title>
      <para>
        Booting via PXE requires a DHCP and a TFTP server in your network. The computer
        will boot then without a physical media like a boot floppy or CDROM.
      </para>
      <para>
        Here is a small example of a "/srv/tftp/pxelinux.cfg/default" file:
      <screen>
default SLES9

# install SLES9
label SLES9
  kernel linux_sles9
    append initrd=initrd_sles9 vga=0x0314 install=.... autoyast=... language=de_DE

# boot harddisc
label hd·
  LOCALBOOT 0
      </screen>
      </para>
      <para>
        It's recommended to add the vga=... parameter with a valid value for graphical
        installations, to trigger an installation with the frame buffer device instead
        of the vesa driver or ncurses mode.
      </para>
      <para>
        Here is as a small example my "/etc/dhcp.conf" file:
      <screen>
option domain-name-servers 192.168.66.1;
default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;
ddns-update-style none; ddns-updates off;
log-facility local7;
option grub-menufile code 150 = text;
option grub-menufile "(nd)/menu.lst";·
subnet 192.168.66.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
        range 192.168.66.100 192.168.66.200;
        # PXE related stuff ...
        #
        # "next-server" defines the tftp server which will·
        # serve the pxelinux image to the PXE clients.
        next-server 192.168.66.1;
        allow booting;
        allow bootp;
        option routers 192.168.66.1; # default gateway

        #
        # "filename" specifies the pxelinux image on the tftp server·
        # which will be served to the PXE clients.
        # The configured tftp server on 192.168.100.1 runs in a·
        # "change-root jail" to /srv/tftpboot
        filename "pxelinux.0";
}
      </screen>
      </para>
      <para>
        A problem you might run into if you do installation via PXE is, that the
        installation will run into an endless loop, because after the first reboot,
        the machine is doing PXE boot again and will restart the installation instead
        of booting from harddisc for the second stage of the installation.
      </para>
      <para>
        This problem can be solved in different ways. One way is to use a http server
        to provide the autoyast profile and instead of a static profile, a CGI script
        on the webserver is run that provides the profile and then changes the TFTP server
        configuration then for this special host, so that the next PXE boot from that
        machine will be from harddisc by default.
      </para>
      <para>
        Another way is to use autoyast to upload a new PXE boot configuration for that host.
        That is done via autoyast profile like this:
        <screen>
          <![CDATA[
      <pxe>
       <pxe_localboot config:type="boolean">true</pxe_localboot>
       <pxelinux-config>
DEFAULT linux
  LABEL linux
  localboot 0


       </pxelinux-config>
       <tftp-server>192.168.66.1</tftp-server>
       <pxelinux-dir>/pxelinux.cfg</pxelinux-dir>
       <filename>__MAC__</filename>   <!-- since openSUSE 11.2, not SLES11 -->
     </pxe>
]]>
        </screen>
       This will upload a new configuration for the actual machine to the tftp server short
       before the first reboot happens. In most installations the TFTP daemon runs as user
       "nobody". You have to make sure that that user has write permissions to the "pxelinux.cfg"
       directory if you use that mechanism.
       So if your machine got the IP address "192.168.66.195" a file "C0A842C3" will
       be uploaded and if the machine reboots and will get the same IP address
       via DHCP again, the new configuration will be used that has the harddisc as
       a default boot media.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course this requires that the machine will get the same IP address again after the
       reboot and if you want to do another autoinstallation for that machine, you have to
       remove the file from the TFTP server.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since openSUSE 11.2 (not SLES11) you can configure the filename too that will be uploaded.
       If you use the "magic" __MAC__ filename, the filename will be the mac address of your machine like this "01-08-00-27-79-49-ee".
       A missing filename creates the IP address filename like in the past.

	Several scenarios for auto-installation are possible using different
	types of infrastructure and source media. The simplest way is by using
	the source media from the  &company-suse;  Box. In that case you have
	either a DVD with all  &company-suse;  packages or a set of CD-ROMs. To initiate the
	auto-installation process however, the auto-installation command line
	variable should be entered at system boot-up and the control file should
	be accessible to YaST2. The following list of scenarios explains how
	the control file can be supplied and the setup needed for the

            adding the <emphasis>instmode=cd</emphasis> option to the kernel

      </para>

      <orderedlist numeration="arabic">
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Specify the exact location of the control file:

autoyast=http://192.168.1.1/control-files/client01.xml
	    </screen>
	  </para>
	</listitem>

	  </para>
	  <screen>
autoyast=http://192.168.1.1/control-files/
	  </screen>
	  <para>
	    In this case the relevant control file is retrieved using the hex digit
	    representation of the IP as described below.
	  </para>	    	    
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <para>	
	If only the path prefix variable is defined, &yast2; will fetch the
	control file from the specified location in the following way:
      </para>
      <orderedlist numeration="arabic">
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    First, it will search for the control file using its own IP address in
	    upper case hexadecimal, e.g. <emphasis>192.0.2.91 -> C000025B</emphasis>.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    If that file is not found, it will remove one hex digit and try
	    again. This action is repeated till the file with the correct name
	    is found.  Ultimately, it will try looking for a file with the MAC
	    address of the clients as the file name (mac should have the
	    following syntax: <emphasis>0080C8F6484C</emphasis>) and if not found a file named 
	    <filename>default</filename> (in lower
	    case).
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>
    
    <para>
      As an example, for 192.0.2.91, the HTTP client will try:

C000025
C00002

default
    </literallayout>
    <para>
      in that order. 
      </para>
      <para>
	To determine the hex representation of the IP address of the client,
	use the utility called <command>/usr/sbin/gethostip</command> available
	with the <emphasis>syslinux</emphasis> package.
      </para>

	The easiest way to auto-install a system  without any network connection

      System Configuration 
    </title>
    <para>
      The system configuration during auto-installation can be seen as the
      most important part of the whole process. Customizing a system to your
      environment needs is what makes an auto-installation system attractive,
      not the installation part.
    </para>
    <para>
      As you have seen in the previous chapters, almost anything can be
      configured automatically on the target system. In addition to the
      pre-defined directives, you can always  use post-scripts to change other
      things in the system. Additionally you can change any system variables and
      if required, copy complete configuration files into the target system.
    </para>
    <section>
      <title>
	Post-Install and System Configuration
      </title>
      <para>
	The Post-Installation and the System Configuration are initiated directly after the last
	package is installed in the target system  and is continued after the
	system has booted for the first time.
      </para>
      <para>
	Before the system is booted for the first time, &yast2; writes all data
	collected during installation into the system and finally it writes the
	boot loader in the specified location. In addition to these regular
	tasks, which are also done when performing a regular installation, YaST2
	executes the <emphasis>chroot-scripts</emphasis> as specified in the
	control file. Note that these scripts are executed while the system is
	still not mounted.
      </para>      
      <para>
	If a different kernel than the default is installed, a hard reboot will
	be required. A hard reboot can also be forced during auto-installation,
	independent of the installed kernel. This can be accomplished using the
	<emphasis>reboot</emphasis> property of the
	<emphasis>general</emphasis> resource. (See <link
	  linkend="CreateProfile.General">General Options</link>)

      <title>System Customization</title>
      <para>
	Most of the system customization is done in the second stage of the
	installation. &yast2; provides most of the important resources needed to
	bring up  a system to a usable , general state. However, you may have
	other requirements for the installed system. If the required
	customizations can't be done using &yast2; resources, then the
	post-install scripts can be used to accomplish this task.
      </para>
      <para>
	You can define an unlimited number of custom scripts in the control
	file either by editing the control file or by using the configuration
	system.
